# Code refactor
Using code from Horiseon, inc, I refactored it to increase web assessibility to those with disabilities and to ensure efficiency. We were asked to re-organize the HTML structural and semantic elements, add alt attributes to images, and clean CSS class and id's.

I focused on the HTML code first, ordering it into header, sections, asides, body and footer. Next, I used the alt tag to accurating describe each image. These improvements allowed me to then condense the CSS classes and IDs.
